			<p>Microsoft's offers Windows 10 in two versions: Home and Pro(fessional). It's easy to understand on a conceptual level what this means: Pro is for people to use at work, and Home is for personal machines. But what's the real difference? Let's take a look at Windows 10 Home vs Pro. The bottom line is Windows 10 Pro offers more than its Home counterpart, which is why it's more expensive. There's nothing Windows 10 Home can do that Pro can't. In fact, they're largely the same operating system. The difference, then, is based on whether the license you activate is for Home or Pro. You've probably done this before, either when installing Windows, or setting up a new PC for the first time; you reach a point in the process where you enter a 25-character Product ID (license key).Based on that key, Windows will make a set of features available to you within the OS. The features average users need are present in Home. Pro offers more features, but this refers to built-in functions of Windows, and many of them are tools only system administrators would be interested in.So the question is, what precisely are these additional things in the Pro version features, and do you need them?</p>
