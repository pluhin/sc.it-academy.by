                    <h1>Beijing</h1>
                    <h2>Ethymology</h2>
                    <p>Beijing (/beɪˈdʒɪŋ/, alternatively /beɪˈʒɪŋ/;  Mandarin pronunciation: [pèi.tɕíŋ] (About this soundlisten)), formerly romanized as Peking, is the capital of the People's Republic of China, the world's third most populous city proper, and most populous capital city. The city, located in northern China, is governed as a municipality under the direct administration of central government with 16 urban, suburban, and rural districts. Beijing Municipality is surrounded by Hebei Province with the exception of neighboring Tianjin Municipality to the southeast; together the three divisions form the Jingjinji metropolitan region and the national capital region of China.</p>
                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>The earliest traces of human habitation in the Beijing municipality were found in the caves of Dragon Bone Hill near the village of Zhoukoudian in Fangshan District, where Peking Man lived. Homo erectus fossils from the caves date to 230,000 to 250,000 years ago. Paleolithic Homo sapiens also lived there more recently, about 27,000 years ago. Archaeologists have found neolithic settlements throughout the municipality, including in Wangfujing, located in downtown Beijing.</p>
                    <h2>Geography</h2>
                    <p>Beijing is situated at the northern tip of the roughly triangular North China Plain, which opens to the south and east of the city. Mountains to the north, northwest and west shield the city and northern China's agricultural heartland from the encroaching desert steppes. The northwestern part of the municipality, especially Yanqing County and Huairou District, are dominated by the Jundu Mountains, while the western part is framed by Xishan or the Western Hills. The Great Wall of China across the northern part of Beijing Municipality was built on the rugged topography to defend against nomadic incursions from the steppes. Mount Dongling, in the Western Hills and on the border with Hebei, is the municipality's highest point, with an altitude of 2,303 metres (7,556 ft).</p>
                    <h2>Demographics</h2>
                    <p>In 2013, Beijing had a total population of 21.148 million within the municipality, of which 18.251 million resided in urban districts or suburban townships and 2.897 million lived in rural villages. The encompassing metropolitan area was estimated by the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) to have, as of 2010, a population of 24.9 million.</p>

                    <h1>Guangzhou</h1>
                    <h2>Names</h2>
                    <p>Guǎngzhōu is the pinyin romanisation of the Chinese name 廣州, which was simplified in mainland China to 广州 in the 1950s. The name of the city is taken from the ancient Guang Province (Guang Zhou), after it had become the prefecture's seat of government, which is how some other Chinese cities, including Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Fuzhou got their names. The character 廣 or 广—which also appears in the names of the provinces Guangdong and Guangxi, together called the Liangguang—means "broad" or "expansive" and refers to the intention to dispense imperial grace broadly in the region with the founding of county of Guangxin in Han Dynasty.</p>
                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <h4>Prehisory</h4>
                    <p>A settlement now known as Nanwucheng was present in the area by 1100 bc. Some traditional Chinese histories placed Nanwucheng's founding during the reign of Ji Yan, king of Zhou from 314–256 bc. It was said to have consisted of little more than a stockade of bamboo and mud.</p>
                    <h4>Nanyue</h4>
                    <p>Panyu was established on the east bank of the Pearl River in 214 bc to serve as a base for the Qin Empire's first failed invasion of the Baiyue lands in southern China. Legendary accounts claimed the soldiers at Panyu were so vigilant that they did not remove their armor for three years. Upon the fall of the Qin, General Zhao Tuo established his own kingdom of Nanyue and made Panyu its capital in 204 bc.</p>
                    <h4>Imperial China</h4>
                    <p>Incorporated into the Han Empire, Panyu became a provincial capital. In ad 226, it became the seat of Guang Prefecture, which gave it its modern name. The Old Book of Tang described Guangzhou as an important port in southern China. Direct routes connected the Middle East and China, as shown in records of a Chinese prisoner returning home from Iraq twelve years after his capture at Talas. Relations were not always peaceful: Muslims sacked the city on 30 October 758 and were massacred by the Chinese rebel Huang Chao in 878, along with the city's Jews, Christians, and Parsis.</p>
                    <h4>Modern China</h4>
                    <p>During the late Qing Dynasty, Guangzhou was the site of failed revolts such as the Uprisings of 1895 and 1911 to overthrow the Qing; the 72 rebels whose bodies were found after the latter uprising are remembered and honoured as the city's 72 Martyrs in the Huanghuagang ("Yellow Flower Mound") Mausoleum.</p>
                    <h2>Geography<img class="guangzhou" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fe/Guangzhou_montage.png"></h2>
                    <p>The elevation of the prefecture generally increases from southwest to northeast, with mountains forming the backbone of the city and the ocean comprising the front. Tiantang Peak (天堂顶, "Heavenly Peak") is the highest point of elevation at 1,210 metres (3,970 ft) above sea level.</p>
                    <h2>Economy</h2>
                    <p>Guangzhou is the main manufacturing hub of the Pearl River Delta, one of mainland China's leading commercial and manufacturing regions. In 2017, the GDP reached ¥2,150 billion (US$318 billion), per capita was ¥150,678 (US $22,317). Guangzhou is considered one of the most prosperous cities in China. Owing to rapid industrialisation, it is also considered one of the most polluted cities once. But as city development goes greener, it is now one of the most livable cities in China</p>

                <p>It is really hard for me to say the differences.
                If people are heavily shaped by local languages, then the languages of these 3 cities are so different.</p>
                <p>From this point of view, Beijing people are more open-minded. Shanghai people are proud of their fashion and strict standard of service.</p>
                <p>Guangzhou is mysterious to me. Chime Long is based in Guangzhou. Chime Long was a struck to me. Guangzhou people can’t be defined as typical Chinese, you know, like me, rigid in heart, unconscious always, my soul sad and homeless, knowing little about science and technologies after college. I am better better off after giving birth to my daughter, because I have to learn psychology for parenting.</p>
